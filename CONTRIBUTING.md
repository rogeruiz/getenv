## Welcome!

I'm so glad you're thinking about contributing to Tick CLI! If you're unsure
about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The
worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something.

I want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of my projects. Please be
kind.

I encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here),
its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).
